LICENSE:
Boost, see LICENSE_1_0.txt


COMPILING:
There is one cpp file. It is only dependent on Boost. So compilation should
be extremely simple, for example:

clang -I . -I /home/barend/git/boost/modular-boost/ -o ../bin/tissot tissot.cpp -lstdc++


RUNNING:
- compile (as above)
- download proj4
- modify all.sh (in bin) to configure the input path where proj4 resides
- if desired, modify all.sh to configure the output path
- run all.sh
